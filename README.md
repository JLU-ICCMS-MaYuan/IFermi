# ferm-surf
A program implemented in python which takes structured output from DFT simulation software (VASP) and plots the Fermi-surface of these materials.

Future devlopments will include surface projections for comparison with experimental Fermi-surfaces, calulcation of a nesting parameter, and identification of Fermi-arcs.

Dependencies: 
1. Pymatgen 
2. BoltzTraP2
3. plotly
3. matplotlib
4. colorlover (colours for Plotly plots)
